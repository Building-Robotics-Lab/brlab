                abstract: "Occupants in buildings often play a passive role in controlling their environmental settings, leading to significant dissatisfaction and energy wastage. This challenge underscores the need for innovative approaches that not only enhance environmental control but also actively engage occupants in the process. To address these challenges, this study introduces a novel occupantcentric Digital Twin (DT) framework, examining the impact of three distinct user interface (UI) types: person-based, object-based, and recommendation-based controls on user satisfaction, preferences under different scenarios, and data sharing preferences. Through experiments involving 120 participants, this study revealed that preferences for specific user interface (UI) types vary significantly across different scenarios. Furthermore, the study delves into occupant responses to personal data and privacy measures associated with DT systems, highlighting their crucial role in building trust and facilitating data sharing. The findings advocate for a personalized approach in occupant-centric DT implementations, suggesting that flexible and adaptive UIs can significantly enhance occupant engagement and satisfaction

                abstract: "Heat gain through the buildings opaque facades significantly contributes to the energy consumption of Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems. In the post-construction phase, retrofitting options for reducing façade heat gain are limited, with cool paints being the prevalent strategy. However, the efficacy of shading systems as an alternative strategy remains underexplored as existing research predominantly focuses on proof-of-concept validation, often overlooking a comprehensive assessment of shading system configurations across diverse climates and building typologies. Moreover, a comparative analysis of the performance and potential synergies between cool paints and shading systems on opaque facades is crucial to understand their actual effectiveness in real-world applications. To address these gaps, our study undertakes an extensive parametric simulation, taking into account variables such as shading configurations, cool paints with varying facade solar absorbance values, facade orientation, diverse climates, and different building typologies. The results demonstrate that the use of shading on opaque facades alone could result in a HVAC energy saving of 8-28%, while the application of cool paints (façade absorptance value of 0.2) alone could reduce the HVAC energy consumption by 10-35%. By combining the use of shading and cool paints, the HVAC energy savings are further increased by 2-5%. The findings of this study offer a novel perspective on the selection of opaque façade technologies, broadening the sustainable design and retrofit options.",

                abstract: "To improve occupant comfort and save energy in buildings, we have developed a closed-loop air conditioning (AC) sensor-controller that predicts occupant thermal sensation from the thermographic measurement of skin temperature distribution, then uses this information to reduce overcooling (cooling-energy overuse that discomforts occupants) by regulating AC output. Taking measures to protect privacy, it combines thermal-infrared (TIR) and color (visible spectrum) cameras with machine vision to measure the skin-surface temperature profile. Since the human thermoregulation system uses skin blood flow to maintain thermoneutrality, the distribution of skin temperature can be used to predict warm, neutral, and cool thermal states. We conducted a series of human-subject thermal-sensation trials in cold-to-hot environments, measuring skin temperatures and recording thermal sensation votes. We then trained random-forest classification machine-learning models (classifiers)—to estimate thermal sensation from skin temperatures or skin-temperature differences. The estimated thermal sensation was input to a PI control algorithm for the AC, targeting a sensation level between neutral and warm. Our sensor-controller includes a sensor assembly, server software, and client software. The server software orients the cameras and transmits images to the client software, which in turn assesses occupant skin temperature distribution, estimates occupant thermal sensation, and controls AC operation. A demonstration conducted in a conference room in an office building near Houston, TX showed that our system reduced overcooling, decreasing AC load by 42% when the room was occupied while improving occupant comfort (fraction of “comfortable” votes) by 15 percentage points.",

                abstract: "Daylight has a positive impact on the health, pleasure, and productivity of office workers. Analyzing how environmental parameters affect daylight's visual effects can help effectively evaluate daylight sensation and assist architects in creating more appropriate daylight environments. The study explores the impact of different daylight environments on occupants' perception via extensive controlled daylight experiments in Harbin, China. Based on the experimental results, we find two common factors in the visual effects of daylight through exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis. Take the evaluation factors (daylight satisfaction and daylight complexity) with the highest factor loading coefficient in each common factor as an example, construct a predictive model based on the XGBoost algorithm and validate its performance. Then, the SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) method is used to analyze the influence mechanism of feature parameters and their interaction combinations on the visual effects of daylight in office spaces. The results indicate that the feature parameter Ltask/Lm significantly impacts daylight satisfaction and complexity. The interaction combination between feature parameters Ltask/Lm and Ltask significantly influences daylight satisfaction evaluation. In contrast, the combination of Lmed and Daylight Glare Probability (DGP) contributes the most to daylight complexity. The study addresses theoretical and technical gaps in the visual effects study of daylight through questionnaire assessment and explanatory analysis, enhancing the precision and scientific rigor of daylighting design.",

                abstract: "The transformation of personal comfort models into a scalable solution has been hindered by their heavy reliance on occupant feedback across a wide range of environmental conditions, and their inability to adapt to changes in preferences. However, these challenges could be addressed by leveraging large-scale databases to build pre-trained models and using limited occupant interactions to select the most representative model, while simultaneously detecting potential changes in preferences. This paper introduces a novel transformer-based architecture (ComfortGPT), which employs pre-trained models built on the data derived from ECOBEE Donate Your Data program through a uniquely crafted cleaning process. The pre-trained models are derived through clustering the supervised learning models applied to each user's data, thereby capturing the diverse range of thermostat preferences. Due to their generative nature, these models can predict setpoints across a wide range of environmental conditions. In order to adapt to variations in occupant preferences, we adopted a transformer mechanism to encode user thermostat interactions based on time sequence and relevance. We applied an exhaustive search to identify the optimal hyperparameters and achieved R2 of 0.77 and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.65°C. We also found that the pre-trained models represent a spectrum of setpoint/outdoor temperature relationships ranging from warm-likers to cool-likers and referred to them as comfort archetypes. These archetypes could be employed in energy simulations and design applications, facilitating more personalized and energy-efficient indoor environments.",

                abstract: "With the advent of flexible working arrangements, we are observing a dramatic shift in how buildings are occupied today, which presents an opportunity to optimize Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning system temperature setpoints based on variations in occupancy. Guidelines often suggest the adoption of the highest or lowest setpoint or setback to minimize energy consumption in hot or cold climates, respectively. However, at outdoor temperatures where variations in occupancy heat loads prompt buildings to fluctuate across cooling, free-running, and heating mode, optimal setpoints and setbacks are not always the lowest or highest. In addition, the perturbations caused by rapid switching between setpoint and setback could diminish energy savings due to system destabilization. This paper aims to systematically compare the potential energy savings from fixed and optimal setpoints and setbacks across wide-ranging occupancy scenarios (four occupancy rates and 14 patterns). Energy simulations were conducted using the Department of Energy reference models for small, medium, and large office buildings to enable an exhaustive search of optimal setpoint/setbacks in 17 climate zones. Explored setpoints were 19.5 °C to 25.5 °C with intervals of 1 °C, and setbacks were 17 °C/19 °C for heating and 26 °C/28 °C for cooling. The findings indicate that, on average, while lower occupancy heat loads results in 5.48% energy reduction, a conventional fixed setpoint and setback strategy provides an additional 11.80%, and optimal selection of setpoints and setbacks could provide an additional 34.36–38.08%, emphasizing the untapped potential energy saving. To facilitate practical applications, this paper presents an interactive graphical interface: Optimal Temperature Setpoint Tool.",

While current research primarily leans on the Leaf Area Index to estimate the VGS cooling potentials, the evaporative cooling effects of VGS growing media, has largely been overlooked. In particular, the effect of plant growth form on air movement within the VGS, which could notably augment the rate of evapotranspiration, has commonly been ignored. To address this gap, our study undertakes a comprehensive thermal analysis of two distinct plant growth forms (porous and dense), combining systematic Computational Fluid Dynamics simulations with field experiments over a six-month period. Our results, for the first time, demonstrate that the provision of a porous VGS significantly enhances its cooling effects, which could even lead to a negative façade heat flux. Our findings offer a novel perspective for plant and growing media selection in VGS design.",

                abstract: "While legacy building digital twins (DTs), such as building management systems, help building and facility managers to make informed decisions, the real end-users of buildings, i.e., occupants, have been considered as data informants without agency for access to and interaction with DT systems. This is due to the lack of multi-user interfaces for occupants to interact with building systems effectively with sufficient observability and controllability. The research on the design of multi-user interfaces has been limited to specialized services in public, shared spaces, or office-specific experiments and fails to produce detailed design principles. In this study, we explore the “democratization of DTs” as an occupant-building interface that invites occupants to monitor the building- and human-related data and make informed decisions. An occupant participatory approach was employed, consisting of a survey, an experience sampling method, and a co-design workshop, to understand occupants' current experiences with environmental controls and desired methods to interact with a DT system. The findings identified five interaction dimensions between occupants and a novel occupant-in-the-loop DT system that provides occupants with observability and controllability over building systems. Accordingly, we establish design principles for DT systems as an occupant-building interface that supports occupants’ dynamic contexts, intuitive controls, collaborative and balanced decision-making between personal comfort and energy consumption, as well as authority and data privacy.",

                abstract: "Building temperature setpoints affect both HVAC energy consumption and occupant comfort. To reduce HVAC energy usage, researchers often investigate how system operations can be optimized under weather and occupancy variability subject to a fixed setpoint that minimizes any possible discomfort. While previous research has explored the selection of dynamic setpoints to minimize HVAC energy consumption based on outdoor temperature, they have often neglected the impact of varying occupancy rates on the setpoints. This paper aims to demystify energy savings derived from fixed and dynamic temperature setpoints under weather and occupancy variability and explores the additional energy savings that can be achieved through dynamic temperature setpoints. An exhaustive HVAC zone temperature setpoint optimizer was developed to determine dynamic setpoints with respect to weather and occupancy (i.e., setpoints that minimize HVAC energy consumption at different occupancy rates based on outdoor weather). U.S. DOE reference building energy models for small, medium, and large office buildings were simulated at 17 climate zones, 4 occupancy rates (25%, 50%, 75%, 100%) and 7 setpoints (19.5°C to 25.5°C at 1°C interval). It was found that, both fixed and dynamic setpoints benefit from the energy reduction of approximately 2-4% from the lower heat generated by the occupants at lower occupancy rates. However, at outdoor temperatures between 5°C and 32°C where occupant heat loads can swing the building between heating, free-running, and cooling modes, dynamic setpoints yield additional 2-10% energy savings, compared to fixed setpoints.",

This study proposes predicting occupant thermal state by a combination of infrared thermography, computer vision, and machine learning. The approach (1) uses cheek, nose, and hand temperatures because they are least subject to blockage by hair, glasses, and clothing; (2) measures the distribution of skin temperatures within geometrically defined sub-areas of the face and hand; and (3) uses temperature differences within and between these areas to eliminate the effects of calibration drift that are unavoidable in thermal infrared (TIR) cameras. Two series of tests were conducted, respectively in an outdoor carport and an indoor environmental chamber, collecting a total of 48,422 sets of cheek, nose, and hand skin temperatures using a TIR camera and computer-vision technology, coupled with 715 subjective responses of thermal sensations. To predict occupant thermal state, Random Forest classification models were built using either absolute skin temperatures (the maximum and median temperatures of cheek and hand segments, and the temperature of the central spot on the nose), or intra- and inter-segment temperature differences of cheeks, hands, and nose. These measurements were found to accurately predict occupant thermal state. Using the maximum and median temperatures for cheek and nose, or for cheek and hand, predicts thermal state with an accuracy of 92–96%. Using only the intra- and inter-segment temperature differences from cheek and nose is 83% accurate; adding the hand temperature differences increases the accuracy to 96%.",

                abstract: "Researchers have shown that the physiological-based personal comfort models (PCM) are capable of addressing individual differences as well as transient thermal comfort. Given that physiological-based comfort modeling studies are often very resource-intensive, a well-developed Design of Experiment (DOE) framework could help by optimizing the experimental sequence and use of resources. This study critically reviewed 74 physiological-based PCMs studies and dissected each study based on a DOE framework, dividing the experiments into the experimental procedures, sequences and variables settings. The results indicate that skin temperature, subjects' thermal sensation and air temperature are the leading input variables for PCM. Additionally, the most dominant experiment settings include a 1-min physiological data sampling interval, 10 min interval for reporting thermal vote, a less than 3 h experimental duration, and a fixed clothing level. We found that the subjects' number is independent of the experimental duration (correlation coefficient of 0.0201). Different activity levels and submerging subjects' hands into hot water are also used as thermal stimuli, in addition to the change in air temperature. By applying diverse algorithms, the average predicting accuracy of PCM from selected studies could achieve 85%, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) shows a superior predicting performance. The prominent limitations of the existing studies include insufficient subject numbers, technical restrictions of sensing devices, cumbersome data collection interfaces, improper machine learning algorithms and lack of diversity consideration. Finally, the review suggested that more related studies in this field should be compiled for cross-validation, helping to trade off the most appropriate experiment designs corresponding to the study objectives.",

                abstract: "In recent years, with the rapid development of cities across the globe and global warming, Urban Heat Island (UHI) and building cooling energy consumption have reached a point of perilous concern. The use of shading systems on building fenestrations has long been known as an effective strategy to minimise façade heat gain as well as glare, resulting in lower cooling energy consumption and indoor comfort. Expending the potentials of shading systems beyond conventional use, the present paper focuses on the effects of shading systems on opaque facades that is currently unaccounted for in simplified Overall Thermal Transfer Value (OTTV) calculations in standards adopted by many countries. A field study was first conducted to compare the effects of various shading configurations on an opaque façade. Subsequently, a simulation study was then conducted to quantify the effects of shading systems on opaque facades with varying thermal transmittance value (U-Value). The results of this study revealed numerous benefits for the deployment of shading systems on opaque building facades, which includes, reduction to building conductive heat gain, building cooling loads, microclimate temperature near the façade, as well as potential reduction to carbon emissions over the building lifecycle. Moreover, the paper also provides considerations for the selection shading configurations, as well as the considerations that would be required for the formulation of a more accurate simplified OTTV equation that would take into account the effects of shading systems on opaque facades.",

This paper provides core definitions, research dimensions, and an overall vision for the future of HBI as developed through consensus among 25 interdisciplinary experts in a series of facilitated workshops. Three primary areas contribute to and require attention in HBI research: humans (human experiences, performance, and well-being), buildings (building design and operations), and technologies (sensing, inference, and awareness). Three critical interdisciplinary research domains intersect these areas: control systems and decision making, trust and collaboration, and modeling and simulation. Finally, at the core, it is vital for HBI research to center on and support equity, privacy, and sustainability. Compelling research questions are posed for each primary area, research domain, and core principle. State-of-the-art methods used in HBI studies are discussed, and examples of original research are offered to illustrate opportunities for the advancement of HBI research.",

The field of HBI builds on several existing efforts in historically separate research fields/communities and aims to understand how buildings affect human outcomes and experiences, as well as how humans interact with, adapt to, and affect the built environment and its systems, to support buildings that can learn, enable adaptation, and evolve at different scales to improve the quality-of-life of its users while optimizing resource usage and service availability. Questions were developed by a diverse group of researchers with backgrounds in design, engineering, computer science, social science, and health science. Answers to these questions draw conclusions from what has been achieved to date as reported in the available literature and establish a foundation for future HBI research. This paper aims to encourage interdisciplinary collaborations in HBI research to change the way people interact with and perceive technology within the context of buildings and inform the design, construction, and operation of next-generation, intelligent built environments. In doing so, HBI research can realize a myriad of benefits for human users, including improved productivity, health, cognition, convenience, and comfort, all of which are essential to societal well-being.",

                abstract: "Occupants play a key role in determining final building energy consumption. Empirical evidence must support occupants' modelling. Experiments on human responses to Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ) are usually performed in test rooms or as in-field monitoring. Between these two approaches, living laboratories, often abbreviated as living labs, represent a valid alternative due to their resemblance to real-world settings. This allows observing actual behaviours while keeping the capability to reliably monitor and control the indoor environment. This work systematically reviewed the available information from 34 living labs for human comfort studies worldwide to define the scope, characteristics, and significance of living labs, for the first time. Most of the reviewed living labs are office environments, and only a few do not involve a university research institution in their operation and management. Most of them are in Europe and the United States, whereas there is a lack of such facilities in other locations and climate zones (e.g., tropics). A larger number of comfort studies in living labs is required to clarify the differences in the knowledge acquired in these experiments compared to in-field and laboratory ones. The review shows that living labs add opportunities for testing and optimizing innovations in human-centric solutions for comfortable green buildings. Through the living labs approach it is possible to holistically capture the influence of IEQ on occupant perception and the related response, to gather data on larger and more diverse groups of people, and to conduct multi-domain comfort studies involving multidisciplinary approaches given their real-life settings.",

                abstract: "Thermal comfort is one of the primary factors influencing occupant health, well-being, and productivity in buildings. Existing thermal comfort systems require occupants to frequently communicate their comfort vote via a survey which is impractical as a long-term solution. Here, we present a novel thermal infrared-fused computer vision sensing method to capture thermoregulation performance in a non-intrusive and non-invasive manner. In this method, we align thermal and visible images, detect facial segments (i.e., nose, eyes, face boundary), and accordingly read the temperatures from the appropriate coordinates in the thermal image. We focus on the human face since it is often clearly visible to cameras and is not merged into a hot background (unlike hands). We use a regularized Gaussian Mixture model to track the thermoregulation changes over time and apply a heuristic algorithm to extract hot and cold indices. We present a personalized and a generalized comfort modeling method, selected based on the availability of the occupant historical indices measurements in a neutral environment, and use the time-series of the hot and cold indices to define corrections to HVAC system operations in the form of setpoint constraints. To evaluate the efficacy of our proposed approach in responding to thermal stimuli, we designed a series of controlled experiments to simulate exposure to cold and hot environments. While applying personalized modeling showed an acceptable average accuracy of 91.3%, the generalized model’s average accuracy was only 65.2%. This shows the importance of having access to physiological records in modeling and assessing comfort. We also found that individual differences should be considered in selecting the cooling and heating rates when some knowledge of the occupant’s overall thermal preference is available.",

Although extensive studies have been conducted on the IAQ sensing systems, a holistic review of the performance and deployment of Ubiquitous IAQ Sensing (UIAQS) systems with associated requirements in IAQ sensing standards is still lacking. In this study, we first reviewed IAQ pollutants and other IAQ-related factors and the associated requirements in the prominent IAQ sensing standards. We found that while non-pollutant factors are influential on occupants’ perception of IAQ and their satisfaction, they do not have evaluation metrics in the IAQ standards. Then, we systematically reviewed field studies on UIAQS technologies in the literature. Specific classes of information were recorded and analyzed further. We found that the majority of the UIAQS systems did not meet the requirements of the prominent IAQ sensing standards and identified four primary research gaps. We concluded that a new holistic and personalized approach that incorporates UIAQS measurements and subjective feedback is needed. This study provides valuable insights for researchers and policymakers to better improve UIAQS technologies by developing personalized IAQ sensors and sensing standards.",

                abstract: "The effect of the built environment on the predominant indoor airflow patterns is significant. To protect the healthcare workers at the front line from the outbreak of COVID − 19, it is necessary to understand the transmission dynamics of the virus, which has been shown to depend on indoor airflow patterns. In hospital operating rooms (ORs), design requirements pose a unique challenge as the positive pressure in the OR can facilitate virus spread into adjacent spaces, shall a COVID-positive patient require a surgical procedure. Moreover, the turbulent vortexes from door motions could independently increase the probability of virus escape from the OR to the adjacent corridors. Therefore, to obtain critical knowledge about the alteration of flow fields due to door movement in a positively pressurized room and quantify the air mixing across the door, a series of experiments were conducted in a controlled chamber. The results demonstrate significant impacts of the door opening on the airflow patterns. Increased alterations near the door and vortexes penetrating far into the chamber with multiple doors openings warrant further study of the indoor airflow dynamic under door motion. This experimental study proposes an algorithm to quantify the air exchange due to a standard door opening and quantifies this exfiltration of contaminated air up to 2 air changes per hour, that is 10% of the chamber supply airflow rate. The algorithm to quantify the dissipated air quantity and the analyses of interaction between initial conditions and door openings contribute to the originality of this paper.",

                abstract: "Occupants’ comfort perception affects building energy consumptions. To improve the understanding of human comfort, which is crucial to reduce energy demand, laboratory experiments with humans in controlled environments (test rooms) are fundamental, but their potential also depends on the characteristic of each research facility. Nowadays, there is no common understanding for definitions, concepts, and procedures related to human comfort studies performed in test rooms. Identifying common features would allow standardising test procedures, reproducing the same experiments in different contexts, and sharing knowledge and test possibilities. This review identifies 187 existing test rooms worldwide: 396 papers were systematically selected, thoroughly reviewed, and analysed in terms of performed experiments and related test room details. The review highlights a rising interest in the topic during the last years, since 46% of related papers has been published between 2016 and 2020. A growing interest in non-thermal sensory domains (such as visual and air quality) and multi-domain studies about occupant's whole comfort emerged from the results. These research trends have entailed a change in the way test rooms are designed, equipped and controlled, progressively becoming more realistic inhabitable environments. Nevertheless, some lacks in comfort investigation are highlighted: some continents (like Africa and South America) and climate zones are found to be underrepresented, while involved subjects are mainly students performing office tasks. This review aspires to guide scientists and professionals toward the improved design or the audit of test room experimental facilities, especially in countries and climate zones where human comfort indoors is under-studied.",

                abstract: "The upper wing wall can be integrated into the windcatcher to prevent direct solar and rain penetration. The impact of this combination was not considered in previous studies. Moreover, analyzing adaptive thermal comfort is another gap that was not addressed by preceding windcatcher studies, particularly for the tropical climate. Therefore, the current research aims to evaluate a two-sided windcatcher incorporated with the upper wing wall from two views: indoor air quality (IAQ) and adaptive thermal comfort. A small-scale model was tested in the wind tunnel. Next, CFD models were validated against experimental data with a good agreement between the two methods. Windcatchers with different upper wing wall lengths ranging between 10 cm and 50 cm were assessed. The results showed that the length increase led to a slight increase in the ventilation rate, and the best performance was seen in the 50 cm configuration. Subsequently, IAQ and adaptive thermal comfort were evaluated at different wind speeds of this climate. The results demonstrated that even in wind speeds below the annual average (2.5 m/s), the windcatcher performance can still satisfy IAQ parameters such as airflow rate and air change rate, recommend by CIBSE Guide A. In addition, based on the simulated conditions the results showed that wind speed from 2.5 m/s to 4 m/s could provide thermal comfort within 50%–80% of the ventilated space. Finally, the estimation of passive cooling power showed that windcatcher could provide a maximum (9.6 kW) cooling power if the wind speed is at 4 m/s and outdoor temperature at 23 °C.",

These patterns are carefully designed for many facilities such as cleanrooms, pharmaceutical settings, and healthcare environments, where human-induced wakes contribute to the transport of contaminants. Therefore, the knowledge about these wakes as it relates to indoor air quality is critical. As a result, a series of experiments were conducted in a controlled chamber to study the three-dimensional effects of true human walking on airflow. Experiments were designed to capture the effect of human walking under three different flow conditions, and for two different walking schemes. The results show that the effect of walking on the airflow is not negligible and can sustain up to 10 seconds after the moving body has passed. Walking on a straight line creates significant change in the velocity normal to the walking path and vertical to the plane of walking movement. These changes were detectable till 1.0 m away from the walking track. Also, the similarity between airflow patterns of walking once and twice illustrated a promising opportunity of predicting the flow patterns of random walk from a set of base cases.",

                abstract: "Providing personalized energy-use information to individual occupants enables the adoption of energy-aware behaviors in commercial buildings. However, the implementation of individualized feedback still remains challenging due to the difficulties in collecting personalized data, tracking personal behaviors, and delivering personalized tailored information to individual occupants. Nowadays, the Internet of Things (IoT) technologies are used in a variety of applications including real-time monitoring, control, and decision-making due to the flexibility of these technologies for fusing different data streams. In this paper, we propose a novel IoT-based smartphone energy assistant (iSEA) framework which prompts energy-aware behaviors in commercial buildings. iSEA tracks individual occupants through tracking their smartphones, uses a deep learning approach to identify their energy usage, and delivers personalized tailored feedback to impact their usage. iSEA particularly uses an energy-use efficiency index (EEI) to understand behaviors and categorize them into efficient and inefficient behaviors. The iSEA architecture includes four layers: physical, cloud, service, and communication. The results of implementing iSEA in a commercial building with ten occupants over a twelve-week duration demonstrate the validity of this approach in enhancing individualized energy-use behaviors. An average of 34% energy savings was measured by tracking occupants’ EEI by the end of the experimental period. In addition, the results demonstrate that commercial building occupants often ignore controlling over lighting systems at their departure events that leads to wasting energy during non-working hours. By utilizing the existing IoT devices in commercial buildings, iSEA significantly contributes to support research efforts into sensing and enhancing energy-aware behaviors at minimal costs.",

                abstract: "In buildings, one or a combination of systems (e.g., central HVAC system, ceiling fan, desk fan, personal heater, and foot warmer) are often responsible for providing thermal comfort to the occupants. While thermal comfort has been shown to differ from person to person and vary over time, these systems are often operated based on prefixed setpoints and schedule of operations or at the request/routine of each individual. This leads to occupants’ discomfort and energy wastes. To enable the improvements in both comfort and energy efficiency autonomously, in this paper, we describe the necessity of an integrated system of sensors (e.g., wearable sensors/infrared sensors), infrastructure for enabling system interoperability, learning and control algorithms, and actuators (e.g., HVAC system setpoints, ceiling fans) to work under a governing central intelligent system. To assist readers with little to no exposure to artificial intelligence (AI), we describe the fundamentals of an intelligent entity (rational agent) and components of its problem-solving process (i.e., search algorithms, logic inference, and machine learning) and provide examples from the literature. We then discuss the current application of intelligent personal thermal comfort systems in buildings based on a comprehensive review of the literature. We finally describe future directions for enabling application of fully automated systems to provide comfort in an efficient manner. It is apparent that improvements in all aspects of an intelligent system are be needed to better ascertain the correct combination of systems to activate and for how long to increase the overall efficiency of the system and improve comfort.",

                abstract: "The ability to inexpensively monitor indoor air speed and direction on a continuous basis would transform the control of environmental quality and energy use in buildings. Air motion transports energy, ventilation air, and pollutants around building interiors and their occupants, and measured feedback about it could be used in numerous ways to improve building operation. However indoor air movement is rarely monitored because of the expense and fragility of sensors. This paper describes a unique anemometer developed by the authors, that measures 3-dimensional air velocity for indoor environmental applications, leveraging new microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) technology for ultrasonic range-finding. The anemometer uses a tetrahedral arrangement of four transceivers, the smallest number able to capture a 3-dimensional flow, that provides greater measurement redundancy than in existing anemometry. We describe the theory, hardware, and software of the anemometer, including algorithms that detect and eliminate shielding errors caused by the wakes from anemometer support struts. The anemometer has a resolution and starting threshold of 0.01 m/s, an absolute air speed error of 0.05 m/s at a given orientation with minimal filtering, 3.1° angle- and 0.11 m/s velocity errors over 360° azimuthal rotation, and 3.5° angle- and 0.07 m/s velocity errors over 135° vertical declination. It includes radio connection to internet and is able to operate standalone for multiple years on a standard battery. The anemometer also measures temperature and has a compass and tilt sensor so that flow direction is globally referenced regardless of anemometer orientation. The retail cost of parts is $100 USD, and all parts snap together for ease of assembly.",

                abstract: "Inhalation exposure to pure and metabolic elevated carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration has been associated with impaired work performance, lower perceived air quality, and increased health symptoms. In this study, the concentration of metabolic CO2 was continuously measured in the inhalation zone of 41 subjects performing simulated office work. The measurements took place in an environmental chamber with well-controlled mechanical ventilation arranged as an office environment. The results showed the existence of a personal CO2 cloud in the inhalation zone of all test subjects, characterized by the excess of metabolic CO2 beyond the room background levels. For seated occupants, the median CO2 inhalation zone concentration levels were between 200 and 500 ppm above the background, and the third quartile up to 800 ppm above the background. Each study subject had distinct magnitude of the personal CO2 cloud owing to differences in metabolic CO2 generation, posture, nose geometry, and breathing pattern. A small desktop oscillating fan proved to be suitable for dispersing much of the personal CO2 cloud, thus reducing the inhalation zone concentration to background level. The results suggest that background measurements cannot capture the significant personal CO2 cloud effect in human microclimate.",

Here we report local thermal sensations and sensitivities for 318 local skin spots distributed over one side of the body, measured on a large number of subjects. Skin temperature changes were induced with a thermal probe 14 mm in diameter, and subjective thermal sensations were surveyed after 10 s. Our neutral base temperature was 31 °C and the spot stimulus was ±5 °C. Cool and warm sensitivities are seen to vary widely by body part. The foot, lower leg and upper chest are much less sensitive than average; in comparison, the cheek, neck back, and seat area are 2–3 times as sensitive to both cooling and warming stimuli. Every body part exhibits stronger sensitivity to cooling (1.3–1.6 times stronger) than to warming. Inter-personal differences and regional variance within body parts were observed to be 2–3 times greater than potential sex differences. These high-density thermal sensitivity maps with appended dataset provide the most comprehensive distributions of cold and warm sensitivity across the human body.",

                abstract: "Energy consumption in office buildings highly depends on occupant energy-use behaviors and intervening these behaviors could function as a cost-effective approach to enhance energy savings. Current behavior-intervention techniques extensively rely on occupant-specific energy-use information at the workstation level and often ignore shared appliances. It is because an occupant typically has full responsibility for her workstation appliances energy consumption and shares the responsibility of the shared appliances energy consumption. However, understanding energy-use behavior of both workstation and shared appliances is necessary for applying appropriate behavior-intervention techniques. Despite this importance, there is still no practical and scalable method to capture personalized energy-use information of workstation and shared appliances since the conventional methods use plug-in power meters that are extremely expensive and difficult to maintain over long period of time. To address this gap, we propose a comprehensive occupant-level energy-usage approach which utilizes the data from the internet of things devices in office buildings to provide information related to energy-use behavior of workstation and shared appliances of each occupant in an economical and feasible manner. In particular, we introduce an energy behavior index which quantitatively compares individual occupants’ energy-consuming data to identify high energy consumers and inefficient behaviors. Results from an experiment conducted in an office building equipped with internet of things devices demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach to classify occupants to different energy-usage categories. Our proposed approach along with appropriate behavior-intervention techniques could be used to impact occupant energy-use behaviors.",

                abstract: "Wi-Fi networks are currently considered as an efficient and economical tool for occupancy sensing in office buildings. Studies particularly indicated that these networks could be utilized to understand/predict occupants' energy-use patterns. Despite the value that investigating this possibility could provide for the current research, it has not been well explored how energy-use pattern information could be extracted from Wi-Fi system information. In response, this study utilizes statistical analyses to investigate the correlation of Wi-Fi flows with miscellaneous electric loads (MELs) in office buildings. MELs account for more than one-third of office-building energy consumption and are the best representative of occupants' energy-use patterns. In the pursuit of the objective, data from two offices were collected over a 3-month period of time. Results from the analyses show that an average 92% of MELs energy consumption could be predicted through the Wi-Fi flows in a building. This finding thereby demonstrates that occupants' energy-use patterns are highly positively correlated to Wi-Fi flows in a building and accordingly, the information of Wi-Fi networks could be utilized to understand/interpret these patterns. This significantly contributes to the current body of research and can be used to support efforts into understanding/enhancing occupants’ energy-use behaviors. In addition, since Wi-Fi networks are a major subset of internet of things (IoT) hardware systems and IoT implementation for intelligent energy management in buildings significantly depends on occupant energy-use patterns, this research helps IoT-based efforts by displaying how these patterns could be extracted from IoT infrastructure.",

Accurate measurement of air movement has been difficult and expensive over the extended periods of time, especially for velocities below 1 m/s. A new type of high frequency ultrasonic transceiver provides high sensitivity measurements and low cost through microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) manufacturing. However, at high frequencies, the conventional ultrasonic signal processing algorithms function only over small ranges of ambient temperature and velocity. In this paper, we describe three algorithms that use the complex phase angle of an ultrasonic pulse to measure velocity and temperature over extended ranges of temperature and velocity. They employ heuristics to track the vibration cycle of the measured phase angle. These methods are applied in a pulse-based anemometer whose 176 kHz MEMS transceivers both transmit and receive. In wind tunnel tests between 0-4 m/s, the tracking algorithm with a low-pass filter measured air speed with high sensitivity and accuracy (0.026 m/s mean absolute error). The ability to monitor to this accuracy with such low power draw and low cost is currently unprecedented in the industry.",

As respiratory CO2 is constantly exhaled, it may not dissipate in surrounding air in absence of adequate air movement and is instead re-inhaled into the airways (breathing in a CO2-rich bubble). In this study, we explored the impacts of context-dependent factors such as office activities, desk settings, and personal differences on the inhalation zone CO2 concentration and on concentrations at a below-neck wearable sensor. We found that all factors significantly impact measurements at both measuring points of our test subjects. Presence of a small portable desk fan was also found to significantly reduce the CO2 concentration. On average, we observed a 177 ppm reduction in CO2 concentration when using a fan, which is 25 ppm higher than the background CO2 measurement (650 ppm). Among 41 test subjects, we found distinct relationships between the inhalation zone CO2 concentration and the wearable sensor measurements and, by applying a hierarchical clustering algorithm, we found 4 clusters of relationships. While below-neck wearable sensors could be used as an exact measure of inhalation of CO2 concentration for 29% of the subjects, we identified a boundary point (917 ppm) separating high and low inhalation zone CO2 concentration measurements.",

                abstract: "This paper presents an uncertainty analysis of subjective thermal comfort measurement, which was overlooked in some subjective thermal comfort studies. Three chamber experiments were conducted to collect the data and to analyze how the uncertainty of subjective measurement is influenced by the survey instrument and the experiment protocol. Four widely-utilized subjective indicators were examined: thermal sensation, humidity sensation, draught sensation and thermal satisfaction. It was found that the Standard Uncertainty, defined as the Standard Error of the Mean, of subjective thermal comfort measurement would decrease with the increasing number of person-votes (number of subjects times votes per subject). When the person-votes were above 40, the Standard Uncertainty of subjective measurement was within 3% of the total scale length, confirming the precision and reliability of subjective thermal comfort measurement. It was found the measurement of thermal sensation/satisfaction and humidity sensation had similar uncertainty level, while the measurement of draught sensation had higher uncertainty. Discrete multiple-points scales (Likert) are recommended for subjective thermal comfort measurement since continuous scales enlarge intra-individual differences.",

                abstract: "Having access to real-time information on building occupants’ state of interactions enables optimization of building systems for improved energy efficiency, well-being and productivity of the occupants. In this paper, we propose a framework to learn occupant interactions from ambient sensing technologies (e.g., sensing of variables such as sound (dB), CO2 (ppm), light intensity (lux), dry-bulb temperature (°C), relative humidity (RH%), pressure (mbar)) from both stationary and wearable devices and select the technologies and averaging windows which contain the required information for learning. In this framework, several supervised machine learning algorithms are tested on the labeled datasets and the algorithm which outperforms others is selected. Two types of sensing devices were utilized for analyses: wearable devices worn around the neck by the test subjects, and a network of stationary devices located in the test subjects' working indoor spaces. 221 employees of federal agencies housed in facilities managed by the US. General Services Administration in the mid-Atlantic and Southern states participated in this study, answering questions about their current task every hour. Overall accuracies were observed of 86.72% for wearable and stationary devices, 81.25% for only wearable-only, and 85.16% for stationary-only for prediction of the mixed multi-label classification via Random Forests algorithm. The high prediction allows for identifying subjects’ tasks when training labels are not available. Predicting occupants’ interactions as a main indicator of occupants’ behavior have significant implications for the energy efficiency of building systems (up to 20% savings).",

                abstract: "Personal comfort systems (PCS) have potential to fulfill building occupants' personal thermal comfort preferences with great efficiency. But to integrate them into building conditioning, there must be a broader selection of PCS devices available. Design guidance and standards are needed to assure that such devices provide high levels of comfort effectiveness and energy efficiency. This study addresses these needs. A suite of minimum-power PCS devices was built that target body parts significant to alliesthesia—a heated shoe insole, heated/cooled wristpad, small deskfan, and heated/cooled chair. They were tested in a climate chamber under cool and warm conditions using both thermal-manikin and human-subjects. Their efficiency at physically heating/cooling the body is high; the combined suite has a coefficient of performance (COP) of 3.6 for cooling and 0.88 for heating. The subjects' whole-body thermal acceptance and thermal comfort perception were improved by the devices in an additive manner; using the combined suite over 80% of people accepted ambient temperatures of 18°C and 29°C. The PCS ‘corrects’ the ambient temperature towards thermal neutrality by as much as 6.5 K cooling and 3.6 K heating, overcoming building occupants' typical interpersonal thermal differences and making possible large HVAC energy savings in buildings. The idea of temperature corrective power can be the basis of standards for PCS.",

In order to integrate occupant thermal comfort requirements, we defined uniformly distributed random constraint functions on the setpoints. We used the DOE reference small office building in three U.S. climate zones for simulating the performances of control policies, using EnergyPlus. Among the four control policies, the building level annual control policy showed close to the highest energy efficiency (27.76–50.91% (average of 39.81%) savings depending on the climate) with comparatively small training data requirements. In addition, the building level daily optimal setpoint selection, subject to thermal comfort constraints, leads to 17.64–38.37% (average of 26.61%) energy savings depending on the climate. We also demonstrate that temporal scale of the policies have a statistically significant impact on the small office building's energy consumption while spatial scale's impact is insignificant.",

                abstract: "More than half of the electricity in residential and commercial buildings is consumed by lighting systems and appliances. Consumption by these service systems is directly associated with occupant activities. By recognizing activities and identifying the associated possible energy savings, more effective strategies can be developed to design better buildings and automation systems. In line with this motivation, using inductive and deductive reasoning, we introduce a framework to detect occupant activities and potential wasted energy consumption and peak-hour usage that could be shifted to non-peak hours in real-time. Our framework consists of three sub-algorithms for action detection, activity recognition and waste estimation. As the real-time input, the action detection algorithm receives the data from the sensing system, consisting of plug meters and sensors, to detect the occurred actions (e.g., turning on an appliance) via our unsupervised clustering models. Detected actions are then used by the activity recognition algorithm to recognize the activities (e.g., preparing food) through semantic reasoning on our constructed ontology. Based on the recognized activities, the waste estimation algorithm identifies the potential waste and estimates the potential savings. To evaluate the performance of our framework, an experimental study was carried out in an office with five occupants and in two single-occupancy apartments for two weeks. Following the experiment, the performance of the action detection and activity recognition algorithms was evaluated using the ground truth labels for actions and activities. Average accuracy was 97.6% for action detection using Gaussian Mixture Model with Principal Components Analysis and 96.7% for activity recognition. In addition, 35.5% of the consumption of an appliance or lighting system in average was identified as potential savings.",

                abstract: "Maintaining thermal comfort in built environments is important for occupant health, well-being, and productivity, and also for efficient HVAC system operations. Most of the existing personal thermal comfort learning methods require occupants to provide feedback via a survey to label the monitored environmental or physiological conditions in order to train the prediction models. Accuracy of these models usually drops after the training process as personal thermal comfort is dynamic and changes over time due to climatic variations and/or acclimation. In this paper, we present a hidden Markov model (HMM) based learning method to capture personal thermal comfort using infrared thermography of the human face. We chose human face since its blood vessels has a higher density and it is not covered while performing regular activities in built environments. The learning algorithm has 3 hidden states (i.e., uncomfortably warm, comfortable, uncomfortably cool) and uses discretization for forming the observed states from the continuous infrared measurements. The approach can potentially be used for continuous monitoring of thermal comfort to capture the variations over time. We tested and validated the method in a four-day long experiment with 10 subjects and demonstrated an accuracy of 82.8% for predicting uncomfortable conditions.",

                abstract: "Previous research efforts, for optimizing energy usage of HVAC systems, require either mathematical models of HVAC systems to be built or they require substantial historical operational data for learning optimal operational settings. We introduce a model-free control policy that begins learning optimal settings with no prior historical data and optimizes HVAC operations. The control policy is an adaptive hybrid metaheuristic that uses real-time data, stored in building automation systems (e.g., gas/electricity consumption, weather, and occupancy). It finds optimal setpoints at the building level and controls setpoints accordingly. The algorithm consists of metaheuristic (k-nearest neighbor stochastic hill climbing), machine learning (regression decision tree), and self-tuning (recursive brute-force search) components. The control policy uses smart selection of daily setpoints as its control basis, making the control schema complementary to legacy building management systems. To evaluate our approach, we used the DOE reference small office building in all U.S. climate zones and simulated different control policies using EnergyPlus. The proposed algorithm resulted in 31.17% energy savings compared to the baseline operations (22.5 °C and 3 K). The algorithm has a superior performance in all climate zones for the goodness of measure (i.e., normalized root mean square error) with a value of 0.047.",

Existing established methods of assessing fatigue include surveys and questionnaires, which are cumbersome to implement at construction sites. This study presents a novel approach for real time monitoring of physical fatigue in construction workers using wearable sensors. Changes in the heart rate, thermoregulation and electrical brain activity during a simulated construction task were monitored from 12 participants using a heart rate monitor, infrared temperature sensors and an EEG sensor. Borg's RPE was used as a subjective scale to collect the level of fatigue experienced by the participants. Boosted tree classifiers were trained using the features extracted from the heart rate and temperature sensor signals and used to predict the level of physical fatigue. Only physical fatigue was assessed as none of the participants developed any sign of mental fatigue during the study. The results show that physical fatigue can be monitored using wearable sensors. The classification accuracy, based solely on features extracted from average of skin temperature data, was 9% higher than based solely on heart rate data, and combining the information from both sensors resulted in the best accuracy of 82%. The results also show that monitoring thermoregulation from temple can be more useful compared to other studied monitoring sites, the classification accuracy based only on data from the temple was 79%. This accuracy is significantly higher compared to the classification accuracy based only on heart rate data (59%).",

Despite the achieved advances, automation systems have not been widely adopted by building occupants. This paper presents our investigations on automation preferences of occupants for the control of lighting systems and appliances in residential buildings. A survey was carried out to determine how preferences for level of automation vary by contexts as well as individuals’ personalities and demographic characteristics. The contexts investigated in this study include rescheduling an energy consuming activity, activity-based appliance state control, and lighting control. The collected data from 250 respondents were analyzed using Generalized Linear Mixed Models. Our findings demonstrate that in all context no automation is the least preferred option. For rescheduling an energy consuming activity, an automation level with higher user participation is more preferred. For activity-based appliance state control and lighting control, levels of automation with lower user participation are more preferred. Our findings also indicate that income and education levels and also personality traits of agreeableness, neuroticism and openness to experience affect the preference of particular automation levels over the others. Findings from this study can be used in designing user-centered automation systems that lead to potentially more satisfying operation and hence, could enhance automation acceptability.",

                abstract: "The common practice of defining operational settings for Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems in buildings is to use fixed set points, which assume occupants have same and static comfort requirements. However, thermal comfort varies from person to person and also changes due to climatic variations or acclimation, making it dynamic. In addition, thermal comfort in transient conditions are different from the steady state conditions, which makes the prediction of thermal comfort more difficult. Thus, thermal comfort has to be monitored over time. In this paper, we present a novel infrared thermography based technique to monitor an individual's thermoregulation performance and thermal comfort levels by measuring the skin temperature on several points on human face, which has a high density of blood vessels and is not usually covered by clothing. Unlike other methods, our method requires no continuous user input or interaction. Our results demonstrate that the monitored facial points behave differently under the heat and cold stresses and it can be explained based on the underlying vascular territories. We define two heuristics to describe the thermoneutral zone based on the observed behaviors and estimate thermal comfort for individuals with 95% confidence level. Considerable variations are observed in the thermoregulation performance and uncomfortably cool conditions metrics between the males and females. Females' thermoregulation system responses are less sensitive to the perception of warm conditions. However, similar behaviors are observed for uncomfortably cool conditions across genders.",

                abstract: "Approximately forty percent of total building energy consumption is attributed to HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) systems that aim to maintain healthy and comfortable indoor environments. An HVAC system is a network with several subsystems, and there exist heat transfer and balance among the zones of a building, as well as heat gains and losses through a building's envelope. Diverse occupancy (diversity in terms of when and how occupants occupy a building) in spaces could result in increase of loads that are not actual demands for an HVAC system, leading into inefficiencies. This paper introduces a framework to quantitatively evaluate the energy implications of occupancy diversity at the building level, where building information modeling is integrated to provide building geometries, HVAC system layouts, and spatial information as inputs for computing potential energy implications if occupancy diversity were to be eliminated. An agglomerate hierarchical clustering-based iterative evaluation algorithm is designed for iteratively eliminating occupancy diversity. Whole building energy simulations for a real-world building, as well as virtual reference buildings demonstrate that the proposed framework could effectively quantify the HVAC system energy efficiency affected by occupancy diversity and the framework is generalizable to different building geometries, layouts, and occupancy diversities.",

                abstract: "This paper provides a systematic approach for quantifying the influence of building size, construction category, climate, occupancy schedule, setpoint, and deadband on HVAC energy consumption in office buildings. Simulating the DOE reference office buildings of three sizes and three construction categories in all United States climate zones, using the EnergyPlus, we conducted several N-way ANOVA analyses to study the interrelationships between setpoints, deadbands and several building related and environment related factors. In summary, daily optimal deadband selection of 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 K would result in an average energy savings of −70.0%, −34.9%, −13.7%, 9.6%, 16.4%, and 21.2%, respectively, compared to baseline deadline of 3 K. Selecting the daily optimal setpoint in the range of 22.5 ± 1 °C, 22.5 ± 2 °C, and 22.5 ± 3 °C would result in an average savings of 7.5%, 12.7%, and 16.4%, respectively, compared to the baseline setpoint of 22.5 °C. Additionally, we found that when the outdoor temperature is within −20 to 30 °C, the optimal setpoint depends on the building size. We also observed a range of outdoor temperatures (e.g., 9–14 °C for small buildings and 8–11 °C for medium buildings) where the setpoint selection would only slightly influence the energy consumption. However, the choice of setpoints becomes very influential (up to 30% of energy savings) where the outdoor temperatures are slightly outside the mentioned ranges on either direction. The potential savings from selecting daily optimal setpoints in the range of 22.5 ± 3 °C in different climates and for small, medium and large office buildings, would lead to 10.09–37.03%, 11.43–21.01%, and 6.78–11.34% savings, respectively, depending on the climate.",

                abstract: "HVAC systems are the major energy consumers in commercial buildings in the United States. These systems are operated to provide comfortable thermal conditions for building occupants. The common practice of defining operational settings for HVAC systems is to use fixed set points, which assume occupants have static comfort requirements. However, thermal comfort has been shown to vary from person to person and also change over time due to climatic variations or acclimation. In this paper, we introduce an online learning approach for modeling and quantifying personalized thermal comfort. In this approach, we fit a probability distribution to each comfort condition (i.e., uncomfortably warm, comfortable, and uncomfortably cool) data set and define the overall comfort of an individual through combing these distributions in a Bayesian network. In order to identify comfort variations over time, Kolmogorov–Smirnov test is used on the joint probability distributions. In order to identify comfortable environmental conditions, a Bayesian optimal classifier is trained using online learning. In order to validate the approach, we collected data from 33 subjects, and an average accuracy of 70.14% and specificity of 76.74% were achieved. In practice, this approach could transform the comfort objectives to constrain functions and prevents pareto optimality problems.",

                abstract: "HVAC systems are responsible for providing acceptable thermal conditions and indoor air quality for building occupants. Increasing thermal comfort and reducing HVAC related energy consumption are often seen as conflicting goals. Few researchers have investigated the feasibility of reducing HVAC related energy consumption by integrating occupants’ personalized thermal comfort preferences into the HVAC control logic. In this study, we introduce a knowledge-based approach for improving HVAC system operations through coupling personalized thermal comfort preferences and energy consumption patterns. In our approach, thermal comfort preferences are learned online and then modeled as zone level personalized comfort profiles. Zone temperature set points are then selected through solving an optimization problem for energy, with comfort, indoor air quality, and system performance constraints taken into consideration. In the case that acceptable comfort levels for all occupants of a zone were not achievable, the approach selects set points that minimize the overall thermal discomfort level. Compared to an operational strategy focusing on comfort only, evaluation of our approach, which aims for both maintaining or improving comfort and reducing energy consumption, showed improvements by reducing average daily airflows for about 57.6 m3/h (12.08%) in three target zones.",

Lack of information about human related variables results in using unrepresentative operational settings, which in turn could bring about low efficiency in HVAC operations. In this paper, the implementation and evaluation of a framework that integrates building occupants’ personalized thermal profiles into the HVAC control logic is presented. The framework enables occupants to communicate their preferences for indoor thermal conditions through a user interface, leveraging a participatory sensing approach. The framework learns occupants’ comfort profiles, using a fuzzy predictive model, and controls the HVAC system using a complementary control strategy, which enables the framework to be implemented in existing centrally controlled HVAC systems with minimum intrusion. Evaluation of the framework in a real building setting showed user comfort improvement. Moreover, the results showed a 39% reduction in daily average airflow when the HVAC system conditions the rooms at occupants’ desired temperatures. Airflow is proportional to the energy consumption of HVAC system components. Consequently, the implementation of the framework shows improvements in the efficiency of the HVAC system's performance for centrally controlled office buildings.",

                abstract: "Building fire emergencies are big threats to safety of building occupants and first responders, and they can result in significant property losses. During building fire emergency response operations, establishment and utilization of situational awareness are of essential importance, enabling first responders, especially incident commanders, to better assess changing on-scene situations and make informed decisions. The paper uses an interactive card game to guide first responders to establish situational awareness about an imaginary building fire emergency, and examines the information items needed by first responders in this process. An evaluation of the importance of each information item is performed. The results show that location and status of occupants and first responders, and status and development of fire and smoke are the foremost important information items. Information items in the “at emergency scene” category were updated on average five times more frequently than information items in other categories. In order to investigate sources for obtaining the above information, and examine requirements for better implementing situational awareness at emergency scenes, a nationwide survey was conducted with first responders in the United States. The results point out a discrepancy between current and desired information sources for establishing situational awareness at building fire emergency scenes. The paper also reports detailed implementation requirements, including type of assistance, level of details and format of representation for establishing situational awareness, and illustrates statistical impacts of location, years of experience and job title on the requirements.",

                abstract: "Centrally controlled heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems in commercial buildings are operated by building management systems (BMS) based on the predefined operational settings and a set of assumptions. Despite the high rate of energy consumption by HVAC systems in commercial buildings, observations showed that a significant portion of the occupants remain dissatisfied with thermal conditions. One of the main reasons is that HVAC systems do not take into account personalized comfort preferences in their operational rules. This study proposes a framework to integrate building occupants in the HVAC control loop, learn their comfort profiles, and control the HVAC system based on occupants’ personalized comfort profiles. The framework fuses occupants’ comfort perception indices (i.e., comfort votes provided by users and mapped to a numerical value), collected through participatory sensing, and ambient temperature data, collected through a sensor network, and computes occupants’ comfort profiles by using a fuzzy rule-based descriptive and predictive model. The performance of the comfort-profiling algorithm was assessed using human subject data and synthetically generated data. For actuation, a BMS controller was proposed and tested in two zones of an office building. The BMS controller uses a proportional controller algorithm that regulates room temperatures to be equidistant from preferred temperatures of all occupants in the same thermal zone. Validation of the framework components demonstrated that the nonlinear underlying pattern of the thermal comfort sensation scale could accurately be recognized. Results of the BMS controller experiments revealed that the proportional controller algorithm is capable of keeping the thermal zones’ temperatures in the ranges of preferred temperatures.",
