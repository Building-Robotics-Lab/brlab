                abstract: "Building temperature setpoints affect both HVAC energy consumption and occupant comfort. To reduce HVAC energy usage, researchers often investigate how system operations can be optimized under weather and occupancy variability subject to a fixed setpoint that minimizes any possible discomfort. While previous research has explored the selection of dynamic setpoints to minimize HVAC energy consumption based on outdoor temperature, they have often neglected the impact of varying occupancy rates on the setpoints. This paper aims to demystify energy savings derived from fixed and dynamic temperature setpoints under weather and occupancy variability and explores the additional energy savings that can be achieved through dynamic temperature setpoints. An exhaustive HVAC zone temperature setpoint optimizer was developed to determine dynamic setpoints with respect to weather and occupancy (i.e., setpoints that minimize HVAC energy consumption at different occupancy rates based on outdoor weather). U.S. DOE reference building energy models for small, medium, and large office buildings were simulated at 17 climate zones, 4 occupancy rates (25%, 50%, 75%, 100%) and 7 setpoints (19.5°C to 25.5°C at 1°C interval). It was found that, both fixed and dynamic setpoints benefit from the energy reduction of approximately 2-4% from the lower heat generated by the occupants at lower occupancy rates. However, at outdoor temperatures between 5°C and 32°C where occupant heat loads can swing the building between heating, free-running, and cooling modes, dynamic setpoints yield additional 2-10% energy savings, compared to fixed setpoints."

To reduce HVAC energy usage, researchers often investigate how system operations can be optimized under weather and occupancy variability subject to a fixed setpoint that minimizes any possible discomfort. While previous research has explored the selection of dynamic setpoints to minimize HVAC energy consumption based on outdoor temperature, they have often neglected the impact of varying occupancy rates on the setpoints. This paper aims to demystify energy savings derived from fixed and dynamic temperature setpoints under weather and occupancy variability and explores the additional energy savings that can be achieved through dynamic temperature setpoints. An exhaustive HVAC zone temperature setpoint optimizer was developed to determine dynamic setpoints with respect to weather and occupancy (i.e., setpoints that minimize HVAC energy consumption at different occupancy rates based on outdoor weather). U.S. DOE reference building energy models for small, medium, and large office buildings were simulated at 17 climate zones, 4 occupancy rates (25%, 50%, 75%, 100%) and 7 setpoints (19.5°C to 25.5°C at 1°C interval). It was found that, both fixed and dynamic setpoints benefit from the energy reduction of approximately 2-4% from the lower heat generated by the occupants at lower occupancy rates. However, at outdoor temperatures between 5°C and 32°C where occupant heat loads can swing the building between heating, free-running, and cooling modes, dynamic setpoints yield additional 2-10% energy savings, compared to fixed setpoints."

To reduce HVAC energy usage, researchers often investigate how system operations can be optimized under weather and occupancy variability subject to a fixed setpoint that minimizes any possible discomfort.

This paper aims to demystify energy savings derived from fixed and dynamic temperature setpoints under weather and occupancy variability and explores the additional energy savings that can be achieved through dynamic temperature setpoints. An exhaustive HVAC zone temperature setpoint optimizer was developed to determine dynamic setpoints with respect to weather and occupancy (i.e., setpoints that minimize HVAC energy consumption at different occupancy rates based on outdoor weather). U.S. DOE reference building energy models for small, medium, and large office buildings were simulated at 17 climate zones, 4 occupancy rates (25%, 50%, 75%, 100%) and 7 setpoints (19.5°C to 25.5°C at 1°C interval). It was found that, both fixed and dynamic setpoints benefit from the energy reduction of approximately 2-4% from the lower heat generated by the occupants at lower occupancy rates. However, at outdoor temperatures between 5°C and 32°C where occupant heat loads can swing the building between heating, free-running, and cooling modes, dynamic setpoints yield additional 2-10% energy savings, compared to fixed setpoints."

                abstract: "Building temperature setpoints affect both HVAC energy consumption and occupant comfort. To reduce HVAC energy usage, researchers often investigate how system operations can be optimized under weather and occupancy variability subject to a fixed setpoint that minimizes any possible discomfort. While previous research has explored the selection of dynamic setpoints to minimize HVAC energy consumption based on outdoor temperature, they have often neglected the impact of varying occupancy rates on the setpoints. This paper aims to demystify energy savings derived from fixed and dynamic temperature setpoints under weather and occupancy variability and explores the additional energy savings that can be achieved through dynamic temperature setpoints. An exhaustive HVAC zone temperature setpoint optimizer was developed to determine dynamic setpoints with respect to weather and occupancy (i.e., setpoints that minimize HVAC energy consumption at different occupancy rates based on outdoor weather). U.S. DOE reference building energy models for small, medium, and large office buildings were simulated at 17 climate zones, 4 occupancy rates (25%, 50%, 75%, 100%) and 7 setpoints (19.5°C to 25.5°C at 1°C interval). It was found that, both fixed and dynamic setpoints benefit from the energy reduction of approximately 2-4% from the lower heat generated by the occupants at lower occupancy rates. However, at outdoor temperatures between 5°C and 32°C where occupant heat loads can swing the building between heating, free-running, and cooling modes, dynamic setpoints yield additional 2-10% energy savings, compared to fixed setpoints."

This paper aims to demystify energy savings derived from fixed and dynamic temperature setpoints under weather and occupancy variability and explores the additional energy savings that can be achieved through dynamic temperature setpoints. An exhaustive HVAC zone temperature setpoint optimizer was developed to determine dynamic setpoints with respect to weather and occupancy (i.e., setpoints that minimize HVAC energy consumption at different occupancy rates based on outdoor weather). U.S. DOE reference building energy models for small, medium, and large office buildings were simulated at 17 climate zones, 4 occupancy rates (25%, 50%, 75%, 100%) and 7 setpoints (19.5°C to 25.5°C at 1°C interval). It was found that, both fixed and dynamic setpoints benefit from the energy reduction of approximately 2-4% from the lower heat generated by the occupants at lower occupancy rates. However, at outdoor temperatures between 5°C and 32°C where occupant heat loads can swing the building between heating, free-running, and cooling modes, dynamic setpoints yield additional 2-10% energy savings, compared to fixed setpoints."

                abstract: "Building temperature setpoints affect both HVAC energy consumption and occupant comfort. To reduce HVAC energy usage, researchers often investigate how system operations can be optimized under weather and occupancy variability subject to a fixed setpoint that minimizes any possible discomfort. While previous research has explored the selection of dynamic setpoints to minimize HVAC energy consumption based on outdoor temperature, they have often neglected the impact of varying occupancy rates on the setpoints. This paper aims to demystify energy savings derived from fixed and dynamic temperature setpoints under weather and occupancy variability and explores the additional energy savings that can be achieved through dynamic temperature setpoints. An exhaustive HVAC zone temperature setpoint optimizer was developed to determine dynamic setpoints with respect to weather and occupancy (i.e., setpoints that minimize HVAC energy consumption at different occupancy rates based on outdoor weather). U.S. DOE reference building energy models for small, medium, and large office buildings were simulated at 17 climate zones, 4 occupancy rates (25%, 50%, 75%, 100%) and 7 setpoints (19.5°C to 25.5°C at 1°C interval). It was found that, both fixed and dynamic setpoints benefit from the energy reduction of approximately 2-4% from the lower heat generated by the occupants at lower occupancy rates. However, at outdoor temperatures between 5°C and 32°C where occupant heat loads can swing the building between heating, free-running, and cooling modes, dynamic setpoints yield additional 2-10% energy savings, compared to fixed setpoints."
