This included clustering pre-trained models to capture diverse thermostat preferences and enocoding user interactions to adapt to occupant preferences. As a result, they found a diverse spectrum of setpoint/outdoor temperature relationships, and achieved a predictive performance of R2 = 0.77 and MAE = 0.65ÂºC. Congratulations you two!
