Their study undertook an extensive parametric simulation, taking into account variables such as shading configurations, cool paints with varying facade solar absorbance values, facade orientation, diverse climates, and different building typologies. Ultimately, they found that shading on opaque facades alone could reduce cooling loads by 8-28%, cool paints on opaque facades alone could reduce cooling loads by 10-35%, and the combined use of shading and cool paint further reduces cooling loads by 10-40%.

The former two have now completed their excellent MSc dissertations for ETH ZÃ¼rich on advanced reinforcement learning strategies for power trading in smart grids and indoor positioning systems using Bluetooth LE and machine vision, and the latter is returning to Shahid Beheshti University to complete the final year of her PhD thesis on optimal distribution of urban density. Thank you to all three for spending time with us and good luck to you all in your future endeavours!

They proposed a transformer-based architecture for setpoint prediction via pre-trained models. This included clustering pre-trained models to capture diverse thermostat preferences and enocoding user interactions to adapt to occupant preferences. As a result, they found a diverse spectrum of setpoint/outdoor temperature relationships, and achieved a predictive performance of R2 = 0.77 and MAE = 0.65ÂºC. Congratulations you two!
